  <p>Medalcase is simply a place to recognise your grit.</p>
  <p>We catalogue run distances of marathon or more and give you the kudos you deserve for getting it done.</p>
  <p>All data is pulled from the Strava API so, "if it ain't on Strava it never happended".</p>
  <p>We build in some flexibility when classifying runs to allow for GPS variations. You can also re-classify your own runs if our matching system gets it wrong - it's an honour thing.</p>
